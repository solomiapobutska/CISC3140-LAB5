## Task 3

### For this task I chose the option:

Apply a "filter" on an image. The filter I chose is the charcoal filter.
This will most likely turn the picture you use into a black & white photo.
Note: You will need to provide a URL of an image when running the script

For Example: ./filter.sh [URL]

Where [URL] is a Placeholder
